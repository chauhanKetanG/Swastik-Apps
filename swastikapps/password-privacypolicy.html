			<p>Your data is only saved on your device. It is not stored anywhere on server or network. So, your data is only in your device.</p>
			<p>In your device also, it is stored in encrypted form. No other app or software can read it. PASSWORD app only can access that data. In PASSWORD app, your data is decrypted and shown when required.</p>
			<p>For security, PASSWORD app requires master-password all times. You must have to remember your master-password. Without it, PASSWORD app can't decrypt data.</p>
			<p>In case of Backup of your data (.spbf file), backup file is also encrypted. But if it is not password-protected, any user having PASSWORD app, can decrypt it. So, for security you should make your backup file password-protected. Password can be set at time when you backup your data. Click on 'Use password for backup' check-box and type password.</p>
