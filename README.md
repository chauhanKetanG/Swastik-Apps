This repository is Swastik Apps website. This website shows my apps which are published on Google play store. I have published around 10 android apps on Google play store. This website contains information about them, like app downloads, rating, description and screenshots.

It uses:
- `html` for web content.
- `css` for styling.
- `php` for backend.
- `mysql` database for content data.

All `html`,`css` and `php` development is done by me. Images and logos are also created by me. Some icons are taken from internet, which are free to use.

This work is not having any lisence or copyright. Anyone is free to use content, screenshots and images.
